# EECS6432
Some code come from the EECS6432.

The first part is for assignment 2. The code is not authored by myself. I got the most of the original code from code given by Teacher. And an dalao changed a little bit. The Function is almost perfect, especially the PID part. 
I just made the code looks more object-oriented like. 
And I added a graph. 

The second part is the project. I did the machine learning part independently. We designed the QNM model collabrately. Me and Yuchen gathered the data and do the coding. Me and Xuan wrote and refine the report. Yuchen generate the charts in the report. 

That's all for now.
